# Pascal's Triangle Challenge

This repository contains code for generating Pascal's Triangle using various programming languages or algorithms.

## Overview

Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical structure where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The topmost number is 1, and each row starts and ends with 1.

## Implementation

### Files

- `pascal_triangle.py`: Python implementation using loops or recursion to generate Pascal's Triangle.
- `pascal_triangle.js`: JavaScript implementation for generating Pascal's Triangle.
- `pascal_triangle.cpp`: C++ implementation to compute Pascal's Triangle.

### Usage

Each file contains an implementation of Pascal's Triangle in a specific programming language. To generate the triangle:

- For Python:
  ```bash
  python pascal_triangle.py
  ```
- For JavaScript:
  ```bash
  node pascal_triangle.js
  ```
- For C++:
  ```bash
  g++ pascal_triangle.cpp -o pascal_triangle
  ./pascal_triangle
  ```

Feel free to explore the code in each file and try different approaches to generate Pascal's Triangle.
